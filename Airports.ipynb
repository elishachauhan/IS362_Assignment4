    "Since the longitude for Dillant Hopkins Airport seems off compared to the other values, it is important to research at least two other sources to confirm that Dillant Hopkins Airport is indeed the northernmost airport. In order to do this, I searched on Google and found two websites that gave the correct latititude and longitude values. In my findings, it was confirmed that the latitudinal value of 72.270833 is actually -72.270833. To confirm the other values, I did the same on my own and the latitudinal values were the same. Here are the two websites in which I confirmed that Dillant Hopkins Airport is the northernmost airport in the United States: http://latitude.to/articles-by-country/us/united-states/179120/dillanthopkins-airport; http://www.airnav.com/airport/keen"

    "According to the table, EWR, or Newark Liberty National Airport, has a wind speed of 1048.36058 miles per hour. Compared to the other values that around 20 to 23 miles per hour, I believe we need to confirm the wind speed for EWR. According to Weather Underground, the max wind speed recorded for Newark was 25 miles per hour on February 12th, 2013. Checking other airports on Weather Underground, these wind speeds approximately correct by looking at data presented (i.e. tables, graphs, max wind speeds). Since the value of 1048.36058 seems like an outlier, the windiest airport may be LaGuardia Airport instead of Liberty Airport with the information given."
